        "1. What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "Logistic Regression is used for classification problems (predicting categorical outcomes like 0/1, Yes/No).\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Regression predicts a continuous numeric value.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Logistic Regression, the output is probabilistic (between 0 and 1), whereas in Linear Regression it can be any real number.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the mathematical equation of Logistic Regression?\n",
        "The logistic regression equation is:\n",

        "3. Why do we use the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression?\n",
        "The sigmoid function squashes input values into the range (0, 1), making it suitable for modeling probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "It ensures that the output can be interpreted as a probability.\n",
